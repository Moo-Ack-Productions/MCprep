# MCprep Kaion

## What is it?
A fork of MCprep focused on advanced features. Most of these features have been suggested in the past but haven't been implemented due to the following:
* Finer details haven't been worked out (most common reason)
* Requires external Python libraries (which can be hard to justify the extra work during installation)
* Low priority (features that are nice and as such aren't worth implementing)

This fork mostly aims to be a proof of concept, so any features that rely on assets (like meshswap) are missing.

## Is it right for me?
MCprep Kaion is not meant for normal use, I suggest using [mainline MCprep](https://github.com/TheDuckCow/MCprep). If you depend on the features that MCprep Kaion provides, it's simply best to suggest the feature on the [MCprep server](https://discord.gg/mb8hBUC)

## Aren't you one of the MCprep maintainers? Why does this exist?
To answer the first question, yes I am, though I don't contribute much to MCprep anymore, see [here](https://standingpadanimations.github.io/posts/goodbye-for-now/) for more. The gist is that I left the Minecraft rendering community due to some drama, and in the process moved away from MCprep as well.

The idea for a fork came when I made the optimizer. I originally wanted to make a version of MCprep with far more power (yet destructive) optimizations. Eventually I also wanted to add features that in hindsight would take a while before implementation details were finalized. 

After I left Minecraft rendering, I wanted to bring some of those features to MCprep, and created this fork.

## Will some of these features be merged eventually?
Since MCprep Kaion is best to be treated as a proof of concept fork for ideas, the hope is that most (if not all) of the changes made here will be merged upstream.

## Why no builds?
Because this is not meant for normal use. If you know how to build MCprep itself though, using this should be simple enough.
