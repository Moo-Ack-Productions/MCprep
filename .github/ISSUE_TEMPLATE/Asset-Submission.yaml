        Thanks for taking the time provide new assets for MCprep! We only include blocks/rigs/effects/entities that are part of Vanilla Minecraft, and try to generally stick to matching Minecraft style (not stylized), however exetra details that extend the animation of a vanilla-style rig, such as arm bends, are ok and even encouraged.
